# Leo
**LeoO** Traffic Generator is developed to help network teams perform realistic, large-scale testing directly in live environments.

# LeoO Traffic Generator (Community Edition)

A lightweight, high-scale network traffic generator designed for **field testing** and
**production-like network validation**.

This community edition demonstrates the core traffic engine and CLI workflows used
to simulate large numbers of concurrent network sessions in real environments.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Generate TCP and UDP traffic at scale
- Designed for field and on-site testing
- Lightweight deployment (Laptop / VM / Embedded Linux)
- Scriptable CLI for automation workflows
- Supports CPS, throughput, and long-running stability tests

> ⚠️ This repository contains the **community edition**.
> The enterprise version supports **200,000+ concurrent sessions**, GUI, and advanced reporting.

## 🎯 Why This Tool?

Traditional tools like iperf focus on throughput.
Hardware generators work well in labs but are difficult to deploy in field environments.

LeoO is built for:
- Customer-site validation
- Wi-Fi / mesh / LTE field testing
- NAT, firewall, and session table stress testing
- Pre-deployment network readiness checks

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Simulate 10,000 concurrent TCP sessions
- Ramp connections at controlled CPS
- Validate network stability during firmware upgrades
- Stress-test NAT and firewall capacity
