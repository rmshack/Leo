# LeoO
**LeoO** Traffic Generator is developed to help network teams perform realistic, large-scale testing directly in live environments.
Designed for in-flight, end-to-end data-path load, performance, and latency validation in live network environments, without reliance on dedicated hardware traffic generators.

# LeoO Traffic Generator (Community Edition)

A lightweight, high-scale network traffic generator designed for **field testing** , **inflight** and
**production-like network validation**.

This community edition demonstrates the core traffic engine and CLI workflows used
to simulate large numbers of concurrent network sessions in real environments.

---

##  Key Features

- Generate TCP and UDP traffic at scale
- Designed for field and on-site testing
- Lightweight deployment (Laptop / VM / Embedded Linux)
- Scriptable CLI for automation workflows
- Supports CPS, throughput, and long-running stability tests

> ⚠️ This repository contains the **community edition**.
> The enterprise version supports **200,000+ concurrent sessions**, GUI, and advanced reporting.

##  Why This Tool?

Traditional tools like iperf focus on throughput.
Hardware generators work well in labs but are difficult to deploy in field environments.

LeoO is built for:
- Customer-site validation
- Wi-Fi / mesh / LTE field testing / Cloud testing for AWS(VPC/EC2/Loadbalancer) with hight traffic 
- NAT, firewall, and session table stress testing
- Pre-deployment network readiness checks
- Inflight testing and simulate up to 200k session with concorent session per second , data rates per seccond. 

---

##  Example Use Cases

- Simulate 10,000 concurrent TCP sessions
- Ramp connections at controlled CPS
- Validate network stability during firmware upgrades
- Stress-test NAT and firewall capacity

LeoO Traffic Generator is developed to help network teams perform
realistic, large-scale testing directly in live environments.

We built this tool because hardware traffic generators don’t work well in field environments. This allows us to simulate up to 200K real client sessions directly in live networks, with both automation and operational usability.”
